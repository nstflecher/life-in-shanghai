It's July 24th in 2019 and it is a rainy day, to be specifically, it is a day of thunder.
I forgot my computer charging power, so i went back to grab it, the rain is almost pouring, what i found interesting on the street is that water comes out in form of flower from the manhole cover.
I couldn't figure out.
